Owen1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"Technicall, there is only a single owen, it is only split up to three object because of simuation logic: each owen objects correspond to on heating step of a long owen, with an inline conveyor belt. To get the right solder joints, more heting zones/steps are needed, in this case three or four heting zones. The reflow owen first melts the solder paste, thus the paste covers the pins of the comopnents, and joints becomes solid during the cooling steps, fixing the components on  the board.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zw53kxy7yL0
